        <br>
        <p>A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company that has business
            operations in at least one country other than its home country
            and generates revenue beyond its borders. Chances are the
            clothes you're wearing, the smartphone in your pocket, and the
            transportation you take to work all have one thing in common:
            they were likely manufactured by an MNC, as are 90% of American imports.
